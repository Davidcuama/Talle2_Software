2. You'll see your bucket in the list
3. Use the exact name as it appears

## ‚úÖ Complete Example

Once you have everything, your variables will look like this:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
export AWS_REGION="us-east-2"
export S3_BUCKET="pokeneasss"
```

## üîí Security - Best Practices

1. **Never upload these credentials to GitHub**
   - They're already in `.gitignore` so they won't be uploaded by mistake
   - Use `env.example` as a template, not `.env`

2. **Rotate credentials periodically**
   - If you think they're compromised, delete them and create new ones

3. **Use specific policies**
   - Instead of `AmazonS3FullAccess`, you can create more restrictive policies
   - Only for the bucket you need

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Error: "Invalid credentials"
- Check that you copied the credentials correctly (no extra spaces)
- Make sure the user has permissions for S3

### Error: "Access Denied" when accessing S3
- Verify the user has `AmazonS3FullAccess` or permissions on the specific bucket
- Verify the bucket name is correct

### Error: "Region mismatch"
- Make sure the bucket and instances are in the same region
